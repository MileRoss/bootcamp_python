    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson, you must install the libraries **SQLAlchemy** and **PyMySQL** on your computer. There are several ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1 (Recommended for Jupyter Notebooks):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open a new Jupyter notebook. In a new code cell, type: %pip install sqlalchemy pymysql\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2 (Anaconda Navigator):\n",
    "1. Open **Anaconda Navigator** and click on the **Environments** section on the left panel.\n",
    "2. In the search bar, type `sqlalchemy`. If the library isn't installed, click the checkbox next to it and hit **Apply**. The system will install the library along with any necessary dependencies.\n",
    "3. Repeat the process by searching for `pymysql` and installing it in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3 (Terminal or Command Prompt):\n",
    "If you use this method, close your Jupyter notebook first. Then, open a terminal (MacOS/Linux) or a Command Prompt (Windows) and type the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install sqlalchemy pymysql\n",
    "\n",
    "You can open your notebook again after installing the libraries."

    "SQLAlchemy is a popular SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides a set of high-level APIs to connect to relational databases. Using SQLAlchemy, you can work with relational databases in a more Pythonic way, abstracting away many of the common database operations. Here's a breakdown of its main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**:\n",
    "   - Allows classes to be mapped to database tables, so you can use Python objects to represent database rows.\n",
    "   - Provides a high-level, abstracted pattern for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\n",
    "   - Automates the process of synchronizing object states with database content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SQL Expression Language**:\n",
    "   - A comprehensive SQL abstraction tool that allows you to build SQL queries using Python expressions.\n",
    "   - Gives you the power and flexibility of raw SQL, but in a more Pythonic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Engine**:\n",
    "   - Provides a source of connectivity to a database, which can be fine-tuned for the specific database dialect.\n",
    "   - Manages connection pooling, which is crucial for scalable applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dialects**:\n",
    "   - SQLAlchemy supports a variety of database backends by using dialects. Commonly used database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle have their own dialects in SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Schema and Types**:\n",
    "   - SQLAlchemy provides a way to declare table structures and relationships directly in Python, which can then be used to automatically create (or drop) database structures.\n",
    "   - Offers a broad set of SQL standard and vendor-specific datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Session**:\n",
    "   - Manages the persistence operations for ORM-mapped objects.\n",
    "   - Acts as a transactional buffer, accumulating changes and flushing them to the database in a batch.\n",
    "\n"
